# Description
Embark on an engaging adventure with my creation in Unreal Engineâ€”a Third Person Character that combines seamless movement and exploration. In this Unreal project, I meticulously crafted a character capable of walking and looking around, offering players an immersive experience. Noteworthy features include:
- Intuitive movement controls for fluid walking
- Dynamic camera perspectives for effective exploration
- A health bar that steadily decreases, adding an element of urgency
- A unique mechanic where, upon reaching zero health, the character ragdolls and gracefully falls to the ground
- Strategic collectables that players can pick up to replenish the health bar and prevent the character from meeting an untimely demise

# Gameplay
Navigate the virtual world as the Third Person Character, exploring the environment, and utilizing precise controls for walking and camera adjustments. Experience the challenge of managing a depleting health bar, making strategic decisions to collect health-boosting items scattered throughout the landscape.

# Controls
Master the game with these controls:

- Move the character using the standard WASD keys.
- Control the camera and look around using the mouse.
- Pick up collectables by walking over them to replenish the health bar and prolong the character's vitality.
- Explore the immersive world, strategically collecting items to ensure the character's survival and a prolonged gaming experience.

# Installation
Embark on the adventure of the Third Person Character by following these installation steps:

- Clone the repository.

- Open Unreal Engine and choose "Open Project."

- Navigate to the local folder containing the game files, head to Content->Maps, and select the main Unreal project file (ending with .uproject).

- Allow Unreal Engine to process all assets and scenes.

- Once the import is complete, hit the "Play" button in the Unreal editor to launch the game.
